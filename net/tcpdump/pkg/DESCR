This package contains the version of tcpdump from tcpdump.org.

It is *not recommended* for general use as it does not drop privileges,
therefore the packet dissectors (which historically have suffered from
many security bugs) are run as root.

To help you remember this, the binary is named "unsafe_tcpdump".
