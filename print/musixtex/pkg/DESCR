MusiXTeX, created by Daniel Taupin, Ross Mitchell, and Andreas Egler,
is a set of macros and fonts that enables TeX to typeset music. To use
it, at a minimum you must copy the macro and font files to the right
directories in your particular TeX file structure, have the binary
musixflx available to run, and have a TeX input file containing the
proper commands. It's a three pass system: TeX, musixflx, then TeX
again.
