M.A.X.R. (Mechanized Assault and eXploration Reloaded) is a fanmade
strategy game by the community of maxr.org. M.A.X.R. is OpenSource and a
remake of the old M.A.X. by Interplay from 1996 featuring network games
based on TCP/IP (e.g. over the internet). The game can be played in a
turn-based mode (with or without time limit), or simultaneous mode (all
the players take their turns at the same time), and features combat in
air, land, and sea. Three resources are present on the maps - raw
materials, that are needed to manufacture units, structures and
ammunition, fuel, that power generators need to function, and gold, that
is used to purchase upgrades. This game is a mix of realtime and
turnbased strategy with battle chess character.
