- relies on unreleased, included version of physfs (2.1.0)
- Problem on startup: Crash in the startup code loading the OpenGL unit:
  crashes in ld.so in _dl_load_shlib because second argument is NULL.
  Somehow, _dl_objects must be set to NULL along the way.  Setting a watchpoint
  in GDB works neither for base nor ports gdb.  Using a simple test program
  that just loads the opengl unit works just fine.  No clue how to proceed. :(
