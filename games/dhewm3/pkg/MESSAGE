To play Doom3 on OpenBSD, you need the original game, patched to
version 1.3.1.  Copy the game data (pak000-8.pk4) to ~/.config/dhewm3/base
and place your CD key in a file called ~/.config/dhewm3/base/doomkey.
Then, copy base.so and d3xp.so from ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/dhewm3/base
to ~/.config/dhewm3/base.
