The Mana project builds a complete 2D MMORPG platform. This includes a
client, server, and web component, as well as a library of free content
that you can use under the terms of the GPL.

While this project started in 2009, the Mana client, server, and web
components were formerly being developed as part of The Mana World since
2004. By separating server/client development from a single player
community, we hope to achieve better cooperation with alternative Mana
server based projects.
