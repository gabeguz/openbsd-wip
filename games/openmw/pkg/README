| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You must legally own and install Morrowind before you can use OpenMW as
it is intended - to play Morrowind. OpenMW is a reimplementation of the
technical aspects of the game only. It does not come with any "content"
-  namely the art, game data, and other copyrighted material that you
need to play the game as designed by Bethesda Softworks. You have to
provide this content yourself by installing Morrowind and then
configuring OpenMW to use the existing installation.

Mount original CD if you have it or, if you have ISO image, read
vnconfig.8 manual to mount it.  After you have mounted either disk or
its image you need to unpack data1.cab with archivers/unshield into
/path/to/morrowind/data dir.  Or you can copy data files from Windows
installation.  You also need to copy directory Video from disk to
/path/to/morrowind/data.

Add /path/to/morrowind/data into ${SYSCONFDIR}/openmw/openmw.cfg
