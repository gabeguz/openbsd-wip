Doulos SIL is a Unicode-compliant serif font designed by SIL
International. Doulos is very similar to Times/Times New Roman, but only
has a single face - regular. It is intended for use alongside other
Times-like fonts where a range of styles (italic, bold) are not needed.

Doulos SIL supports a wide range of Latin and Cyrillic characters.
