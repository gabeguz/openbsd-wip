The basic idea is fairly simple. As 'fuzz testing' suggests, 
we call syscalls at random, with random arguments. Not an original idea, 
and one that has been done many times before on Linux, and on other operating systems.
Where Trinity differs is that the arguments it passes are not purely random.
