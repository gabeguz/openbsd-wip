The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source logic analyzer software that supports various
logic analyzer hardware products.

sigrok-cli is a command-line tool written in C, which uses both
libsigrok and libsigrokdecode to provide the basic sigrok functionality
from the command-line. Among other things, it's useful for scripting
purposes.
