MooseX::FollowPBP does not provide any methods. Simply loading it
changes the default naming policy for the loading class so that
accessors are separated into get and set methods. The get methods are
prefixed with "get_" as the accessor, while set methods are prefixed
with "set_".  MooseX::FollowPBP::Role::Attribute applies a method
modifier to the "_process_options()" method, and tweaks the reader and
writer parameters so that they follow the style recommended in Perl Best
Practices.
