Text::FIGlet reproduces its input using large characters made up
of other characters; usually ASCII, but not necessarily. The output
is similar to that of many banner programs--although it is not
oriented sideways--and reminiscent of the sort of signatures many
people like to put at the end of e-mail and UseNet messages.

Text::FIGlet can print in a variety of fonts, both left-to-right
and right-to-left, with adjacent characters kerned and smushed
together in various ways. FIGlet fonts are stored in separate files,
which can be identified by the suffix .flf. Most FIGlet font files
will be stored in FIGlet's default font directory /usr/games/lib/figlet.
Support for TOIlet fonts *.tlf, which are typically in the same
location, has also been added.

Text::FIGlet can also use control files, which tell it to map input
characters to others, similar to the Unix tr command. Control files
can be identified by the suffix .flc. Most control files will be
stored with the system fonts, as some fonts use control files to
provide access to foreign character sets.
