NFO Viewer is a simple viewer for NFO files, which are "ASCII" art in
the CP437 codepage. The advantages of using NFO Viewer instead of a text
editor are preset font and encoding settings, automatic window size and
clickable hyperlinks.

For best results, use the Terminus font and set the font size to 10.
