Most important note: Redmine will not work in chrooted environment. It needs
access to Ruby, SCMs, fonts and probably something more.

1. Gantt support for CJK
========================

For using Gantt charts in CJK, you need to install ja-mplus-ttf package.


2. Configuration files tuning
=============================

After installation you should adjust the following configuration files:

  ${SYSCONFDIR}/configuration.yml
  ${SYSCONFDIR}/database.yml

database_cipher_key and secret_token should be set separately and unique for
each new setup in configuration.yml.  You can use the following commands for
initial setup:

  # perl -pi -e "s/@DBCIPHERKEY@/`mktemp -u $(jot -b X -s '' 40)`/;" \
             -e "s/@STOKEN@/`mktemp -u $(jot -b X -s '' 40)`/;" \
             ${SYSCONFDIR}/configuration.yml

If you want to use redmine in a cluster, remember to set those options to the
same value on all hosts.


3. Database setup
=================

If you want to use MySQL or PosgreSQL database backend, you must install
an apporiate gem:

         | MySQL                          | PosgreSQL
---------+--------------------------------+------------------------------------
JRuby    | activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter | activerecord-jdbcpostgresql-adapter
Ruby 1.8 | ruby-mysql                     | ruby-pg
Other    | ruby-mysql2                    | ruby-pg

Some of those gems are already in OpenBSD packages, please check them first.
By default, Redmine will use SQLite 3 database /var/redmine/redmine.db.

You need to initialize database schema the first time after installing Redmine
package, and update each time you do upgrade to a newer version of package
(RC script will do all that for you on start for "production" enviornment):

  $ cd ${REDMINE} && sudo -u _redmine \
    ${RAKE} db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

Also you should run the following after installing or updating any plugin:

  $ cd ${REDMINE} && sudo -u _redmine \
    ${RAKE} redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

When installing plugin using the OpenBSD packages, this will be called
automatically.
