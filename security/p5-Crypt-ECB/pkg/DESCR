This module is a Perl-only implementation of the ECB mode. In
combination with a block cipher such as DES, IDEA or Blowfish, you
can encrypt and decrypt messages of arbitrarily long length. Though
for security reasons other modes than ECB such as CBC should be
preferred. See textbooks on cryptography if you want to know why.

The functionality of the module can be accessed via OO methods or
via standard function calls. Remember that some crypting module
like for example Blowfish has to be installed. The syntax follows
that of Crypt::CBC.
